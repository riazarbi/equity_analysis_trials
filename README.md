# equity_analysis_trials
Complete package of trials used in writing my MSc Data Science Dissertation

To reproduce the results in my dissertation, clone in the original code repo:

Then, clone this repo. Copy the `backtest` directory form this repo into the root of the equity_analysis folder. You should now be able to inspect and validate the results in this folder.
